<h3>What is a hackspace/makerspace</h3>
<p>A hackspace also referred to as a maker space is a community-operated, workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and collaborate.</p>

<p>Most people do no have the space knowledge or finance required to create things at home, hackspaces get around this by pooling together for the bigger tools sharing of knowledge and helping out each other to create & build.</p>
