<h3>What is a Hackspace / Makerspace?</h3>
<p>A hackspace also referred to as a makerspace is a community-operated, workspace where people with common interests, often in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Maths can meet, socialise and collaborate.</p>

<p>Most people do not have the space, knowledge, or finance required to create things at home. Hackspaces resolve this in exchange for a monthly fee, by providing a dedicated workspace, a resource pool of like-minded members with various skills and expertise to call upon, and access to tools and machinery.</p>

<h3>How to Find Us:</h3>
We currently have two rooms on the top floor of the Maidstone Community Support Centre.<br>

<h3>Open Evenings:</h3>
<p>Every Wednesday the Hackspace usually hosts an open evening from <strong>5:30pm</strong> till <strong> 8:00pm </strong>, for members and non-members alike. These evenings provide members of the public an opportunity to learn more about us, see the different activities members are up to, and experience the hackspace first hand. Our <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Home</a> page provides a COVID-19 Coronavirus current status, therefore please refer to this first to establish whether open evenings are active or temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>If you want to check the space out or talk to us about becoming a member, Wednesday nights are the best time. Alternatively if open evenings are not available, you can contact us via our <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact form</a> where we can arrange a visit to the hackspace and show you around.</p>
