  <h3>About Us:</h3>
  <p>
    We’re a community-run workshop where people can come to learn new skills, share experience, and utilise tools and equipment to develop various personal and collaborative projects. If you like to tinker, make, and learn and have a fascination for topics such as electronics, DIY, robotics, crafts, and computing to name a few,  it’s the place for you.
